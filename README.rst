A Django app providing simple email confirmation.

This app can be used to support three different ways of organizing your Users their email address(es). Each email address can be in a confirmed/unconfirmed state.

- Users have one email address that is stored on the `User`
- Users have one primary email address stored on the `User` model, and have N secondary emails stored in `EmailAddress` objects
- Users have N email addresses stored in `EmailAddress` objects.


Examples
--------

Create a new User, confirm their email:

.. code:: python

    from django.core.mail import send_mail
    # ...

    email = 'original@here.com'
    user = User.objects.create_user(email, email=email)
    user.is_confirmed # False

    send_mail(email, 'Use %s to confirm your email' % user.confirmation_key)
    # User gets email, passes the confirmation_key back to your server

    user.confirm_email(user.confirmation_key)
    user.is_confirmed # True

Add another email to an existing User, confirm it, then set it as their primary.

.. code:: python

    new_email = 'newaddr@nowhere.com'
    confirmation_key = user.add_unconfirmed_email(new_email)
    new_email in user.unconfirmed_emails # True

    send_mail(new_email, 'Use %s to confirm your new email' % confirmation_key)
    # User gets email, passes the confirmation_key back to your server

    user.confirm_email(confirmation_key)
    new_email in user.confirmed_emails # True

    user.set_primary_email(new_email)
    user.email # newaddr@nowhere.com


Installation
------------

#.  From `pypi`__ using `pip`__:

    .. code:: sh

        pip install django-simple-email-confirmation

#.  Add `simple_email_confirmation` to your `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`__:

    .. code:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'simple_email_confirmation',
            ...
        )

#.  Add the provided mixin to your `django 1.5+ custom user model`__:

    .. code:: python

        from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
        from simple_email_confirmation.models import SimpleEmailConfirmationUserMixin

        class User(SimpleEmailConfirmationUserMixin, AbstractUser):
            pass

    Note: you don't strictly have to do this final step. Without this, you won't have the nice helper functions and properties on your `User` objects but the remainder of the app should function fine.


Python/Django supported versions
--------------------------------

- Python: 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6
- Django: 1.8 to 2.0


Running the Tests
-----------------

#.  Install `tox`__ and `coverage`__

    .. code:: sh

        pip install tox coverage

#.  From the repository root, run

    .. code:: sh

        tox
        tox -e coverage

    It's that simple.
